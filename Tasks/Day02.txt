1) Var let const in hoisting 
2) Data types 
3) Type conversion in JS
4) Hoisting - variable and function



1. Swap two variables
 
2. Calculate the area of a rectangle.
 
3. 

1). Create variables of different data types:
 
I - Declare variables for String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Object, and Array.

II - Use console.log(typeof variableName); to check their types. [observe their behaviour with reason.]
 
 
2).
let name1 = "Pratiksha";

let name2 = name1; 

name2 = "Bhavana";

console.log(name1); 

console.log(name2);
 
 
 
let obj1 = { name: "Pratiksha" };

let obj2 = obj1; 

obj2.name = "Bhavana";
 
console.log(obj1.name);

console.log(obj2.name);
 
 
Run both the above code, and check differnces between them and prepare with reason.
 
 
 
4. Type coercion
 
console.log("5" + 3);

console.log("5" - 3);

console.log(10 + " apples");

console.log(10 * "2");

console.log(true + false);
 
do try above code and do prepare with output and valid reason behind it. (Try more combinations like this.)
