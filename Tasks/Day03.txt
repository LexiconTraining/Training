1) Do Read about  Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment Operators with some poc.

1. Create a simple calculator in JavaScript that:
Takes two numbers as input from the user.
Performs addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
Displays the results in the console.

2.Write a function that:
Takes two numbers as input from the user.
Uses comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, ===, !=, !==) to compare them.
Uses logical operators (&&, ||, !) to evaluate conditions.
Displays the results in the console.

(Optional)
Modify the calculator to take user input for the operation (+, -, *, /, %).
Use if-else statements to perform the chosen operation.



// let x = 3;
// let y = x++ + ++x;
// console.log(y);

/*
let a = 1;
if (a++ > 1) {
    console.log("True");
} else {
    console.log("False");
}*/


let m = 1, n = 1;
let res = m++ && ++n;
console.log(m, n, res);

console.log(3>2>1);
false why?
